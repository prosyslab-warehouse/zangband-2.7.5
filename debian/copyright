Comment:
 The game is not intended to be used for "profit purposes". This
 makes zangband technically non-free according to the Debian Free Software
 Guidelines (DFSG, http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines, point 6),
 but is sufficiently free that Debian is able to autobuild it.
 See http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/11/msg00012.html for
 further discussion on autobuilding non-free programs.
