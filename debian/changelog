  [ Markus Koschany ]
  * Switch to packaging format 3.0 (quilt). (Closes: #693627)
  * Drop postinst script. Upgrading from Debian releases before
    Squeeze is no longer supported.
  * Add 300_fix_explosive_rune.patch which fixes a typo in
    /lib/edit/t_info.txt. This will prevent the script from failing under
    certain circumstances if you cast the explosive rune.
    Thanks Alexander Waldmann for the report. (Closes: #540627)
  * Remove zangband.dirs file, we don't need it.
  * Remove README.source. The version of zangband shipped with Debian is
    pristine. Please use uscan and uupdate to fetch the sources.
  * Update README.Debian and remove the section about known bugs which is
    outdated.
  * debian/rules:
    - Simplify the rules by using dh sequencer.
    - Build with hardening=+all.
    - Build with -Wl, --as-needed to avoid unneccessary dependencies.
    - Build with parallel and autoreconf which ensures the build system is
    properly recreated on every rebuild.
  * debian/control:
    - Add dh-autoreconf to Build-Depends and remove quilt and automake which
    are not needed anymore.
    - Add a homepage field.
    - Remove incorrect ${shlibs:Depends} variable from package zangband-data.
  * Add watch file. Thanks to Bart Martens.
  * Add debian/manpages instead of installing the manpage via debian/rules.
  * Fix spelling errors in manpage.
  * Remove empty directories in /usr/share/games/zangband/lib and
    /var/games/zangband/lib.

    /var/games/zangband/save from 2770 to 2775 on new installations.
  * Add dep3 headers to all patches.
  * Add desktop file and new icons.
  * Rename z_update.txt to changelog and readme to README.

  * Really fix the copyright file. Use the GNU All-Permissive license instead
    of GPL-3+ for the debian directory. This avoids making the package
    non-distributable while the files can remain free. The only occurrence
    of the Angband license is in src/angband.h. The new revision makes it
    clear.

  * libgtk1 is no longer welcome in Debian.  zangband's gtk shell was
    never updated to libgtk2, so ship without it (it didn't really
    work anyway, cf. bug #284414).  Remove Build-Depends: libgtk1.2-dev.
    Note that I will *not* explicitly set "configure --with-gtk=no",
    for the sake of anyone who wants to build zangband with gtk1 for
    themselves (by installing the old libgtk1.2-dev package).
    Closes: #515985.
  * Patch 200_spearOfHagen.diff for Spear of Hagen:
    player.lev not player.level in lib/edit/a_info.txt
    Thanks Guillaume Giroux. Closes: #516064.
  * Random number generator needs help to recognise 64bit systems.
    Patch 120_rng_64bit.diff thanks to spikethehobbitmage.

zangband (1:2.7.5pre1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The upstream makefile has a series of dependencies requiring
    automake (aclocal, autoconf) to be present.  configure must be
    newer than configure.in, of course, but configure.in must be newer
    than .version in order to ensure the automated versioning (from
    src.defines.h) is correctly used.  The problem is that the
    upstream tarball ships configure.in but not .version.
    configure.in is updated locally when autoreconf is performed, but
    the refreshed configure.in is the same in content as the one in
    the original tarball, only the timestamp differs.  It is therefore
    ignored by dpkg-source when generating zangband_2.7.5pre1-3.diff.gz,
    since diff pays no attention to timestamps. So, when unpacking the
    original tarball and Debian diff ready for building, configure.in
    is extracted from the original tarball with the original timestamp
    while .version is extracted from the diff with a date matching the
    unpacking time.  Hence .version is newer than configure.in,
    causing configure.in to be regenerated at build time, requiring
    aclocal, autoheader and autoconf.
    This is the long explanation why automake and autoconf have been
    added as Build-Dependencies. It's just simpler than unravelling
    upstream's automake or tarballing issues.  Closes: #449165.

zangband (1:2.7.5pre1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use Zangband not ZAngband as the title in the Debian menu entry.
    I think the double capital looks lame, and the in-game docs spell
    it either way.
  * Since zangband is hippy-free (free for all uses except commercial
    profiting), it is authorised for non-free autobuilding. Added a
    comment to this end in debian/copyright and the autobuild tag to
    debian/control. Closes: #412859.
  * Split architecture independent data files into zangband-data to save
    duplicating disk storage across different arches.  Closes: #233465.
